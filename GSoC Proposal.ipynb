    "## Description\n",
    "`Variational Inference` is a powerful algorithm that turns the task of computing the posterior(p(z|x)) into an optimization problem.  This project plans to implement two inference algorithms Mean Field ADVI and Full Rank ADVI based on [ADVI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00788) paper in PyMC4. Mean Field ADVI posits a spherical Gaussian family and Full Rank ADVI posits a Multivariate Gaussian family to minimize KL divergence. The implementation will use tf and tfp libraries. "

    "## Key Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For drawing samples from posterior, we need to replace some nodes of the graph with variational distributions. PyMC3 achieves this by using `theano.clone`. Tensorflow v1 implements some similar functions in the `contrib` module - [tf.contrib.copy_graph](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/copy_graph). But the tf.contrib has been deprecated in tf.v2. `tf-nightly` provides [tf.raw_ops.Copy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/Copy) for recursive deep copying of tensor. I will look upon implementations of both `copy_graph`(in tf.v1) and `Copy`(in tf.nightly) and try to implement a feature similar to `theano.clone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide an interface for flattened view of variables. PyMC3 does this using `theano.ravel()`. Maybe it can be accomplished by `tf.reshape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Design an interface to account for minibatches. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Figure out a way to optimize ELBO. `tf.keras.optimizers` is an option or provide an iterative optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Handle the initialization of means and stds for MeanField and Full Rank ADVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Provide a reusable interface to implement more inference algorithms (SVGD, ASVGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Progress Bar ?"
