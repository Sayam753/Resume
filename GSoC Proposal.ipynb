    "# GSoC Project Proposal\n",
    "##  Add Variational Inference Interface to PyMC4\n",
    "`Variational Inference` is a powerful algorithm for approximating the posterior distribution by conditional probability. Generally, VI aims at minimising `KL divergence`(relative entropy) for posterior appromixation. But KL divergence suffers from many statistical disadvantages as described in [OPVI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09033)(Operator Variational Inference) paper. This project plans to implement OPVI framework in `PyMC4` using `tf` and `tfp`. This framework aims at optimizing `operator objectives` which do not explicitly depend on approximating density."

    "## Project Timeline\n",
    " - Pre GSoC Period: Feb 25 - March 15 <br/>\n",
    "Complete the TODO's mentioned in Interface Design. Most of the functionality of Variational Inference revolves around Symbolic PyMC. It will take time for me to understand its complete usage. I will make design less and less abstract as the time progresses and submit the proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Student Application and Review Application Period: March 16 - April 27 <br />\n",
    "I will get myself more familiar with codebase of PyMC3 and begin implementing few base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Community Bonding Period: April 27 - May 18 <br/> \n",
    "I will finalize implementation design for Variational Inference interface by seeking reviews from mentors and community and also referring to OPVI and ADVI paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 1 - 2: May 18 - May 31 <br/>\n",
    "The actual coding begins. By this time, I will have a fair idea of working with Groups. Implementation of Groups(MeanField, FullRank) and Approximation classes will be done in this interval. Rigorous testing will be done by PyTest module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 3 - 4: June 1 - June 14 <br/>\n",
    "During this interval, I will implement Operator, Objective Function and Test Function classes. Same as above, for every functionality, I will write test cases. Also I will create a progress report for phase 1 evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Evaluation Phase 1: June 15 - June 19 <br/>\n",
    "At this time, my focus will be on writing visual illustrations/notebooks for use cases of these base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 5 - 6: June 20 - July 3 <br/>\n",
    "Having implemented base classes, I will write inference and ADVI appromixation classes. Again testing by PyTest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 7: July 4 - July 12 <br/>\n",
    "Implementation of Full Rank ADVI will be done in this time interval. Designing progress reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Evaluation Phase 2: July 13 - July 17 <br/>\n",
    "Again, writing notebooks/blogs to explain good use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 8 - 9: July 18 - July 31 <br />\n",
    "I am not sure if I will able to complete implementation of Full Rank ADVI. But definitely I will keep trying to finish and complete the testing and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Week 10: August 1 - August 9 <br />\n",
    "Writing illustrations/blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Final Submission of Code: August 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Post GSoC Period: August 11 onwards <br/>\n",
    "I will learn and implement SVGD, ASVGD inference algorithms and become a permanent contributor to the organisation. "

I have exposure to programming since a long time and I am interested to work on this project to expand my knowledge in Machine Learning and Bayesian Statistics. Also this is my first time participating in GSoC. As I have no other work planned for summers, I can spend 60~70 hours per week working on the project. Along the way, I will design progress reports and extensive documentation of the implementation of various classes. This will help in submitting reports to mentor and Google at evaluation time.<br/>\n",
